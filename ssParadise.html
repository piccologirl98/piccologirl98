    <h1>Not a Summer Paradise </h1>
    <p>Summer Feels Excited</p>
    
     <h1><br>Is it a illusion or realism?</h1></head></html></br>
    <p> I lay down on bed playing my favorite artists like Namie Amuro, Faye Wong and F4. Suddenly, the bed room disappered and then transmorgify into a beach. I wipe my eyes and I was like, "Is this a dream?". I was all alone in the lonely but utopia beach. The zephyer blows my face to my feet. It feels good but unfortunately, nobody is around. I sprint around the utopia beach while the sun. I sprint and sprint and sprint until I saw the coconut tree. I was so eager to get the coconut to drink because seriously i am so thirsty like a pig. I shake the coconut tree and I avoid coconuts falling in my head so I back away from the coconut tree. Finally, I chopped the coconut and drink it. Tastes so good. "I feel like I'm in Heaven. I took some coconuts with me so I can save it for later or tomorrow. Being on this cozy beach is so much better than being in my room, having a neutural face and everything is all about arguing, fighting, and depression is not my type. What I want is to be with everything is utopian-like. The wind becomes angrier and angrier, tried to blows me away. It affected my eardrums. I tried to hold on to the coconut tree but my hands are more like butterfingers so I have been blown away. The woke up from this hideous and nightmare dream. I was like "Phew, it seems that the wind becomes angrier when I steal those coconuts from the coconut tree. What a nightmare". I learn my lesson not to steal anyone or anything that doesnt belong to me. It was 1:00am in the morning and my face, my whole body, and my feet still feels weary so I decided to sleep.
